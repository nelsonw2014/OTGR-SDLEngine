//=========================== 1 - Introduction ===========================//

    OTGR SDLEngine is a C++ Object Oriented SDL/OpenGL based engine built
    with the purpose of being a modern combination of C++. OpenGL, and SDL
    in a way that is useful, intuitive, and allows for ease of
    implimentation.

    This is designed initially as an exploration of the libraries, but will
    hopefully expand into a tool for which others can use as the basis for
    games and 3D-intensive applications.

//========================= 2 - Getting Started ==========================//

    In order to compile the libraries, SDL2 and SDL_Image need to both be
    available to your compiler. Right now, there is no Makefile packaged
    with the repository, but this'll change in the future.

//========================== 2.1 - Downloading ===========================//

    As of right now, the repository is private, which means you will need
    to be given the ability by a moderator to clone.

    URLs for Git Repositories:

        HTTPS - https://github.com/nelsonw2014/OTGR-SDLEngine.git
        SSH   - git@github.com:nelsonw2014/OTGR-SDLEngine.git

    With git installed, in your command line, enter:

        git clone <URL> SDLEngine

    Once you provide proper identification, the current commit will be
    downloaded and available.

//========================== 2.2 - Installing ============================//

    In order to compile, you must have a GNU C++ compiler, SDL2, and
    SDL_Image installed.

    CD to the directory where you cloned the repository, and enter

    Windows:
        g++ -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image *.cpp -o main.exe

    Linux/UNIX-Based:
        g++ -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image *.cpp -o main

    'main' is the resulting application

//============================== 3 - Usage ===============================//

    Currently very limited. This'll be rewritten.


//============================ 4 - Features ==============================//

    It compiles. This'll be rewritten.

//================= 5 - Planned Features / Future Goals ==================//

    A lot more than it has now. This'll also be rewritten, probably in the
    wiki once I make that.
